<h4>Matthew5 Project 3.000 Toy Engines</h4> 
Davant Stewart<br />

 
The project is named after Matthew 5; I've always liked these verses.<br />
 Jesus when up on a mountain and sat down, he disciples came to him and 
 he began to teach them saying<br />
 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br />
 Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.<br />
 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.<br />
 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.<br />
 Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.<br />
 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.<br />
 Blessed are the peacemakers,	for they will be called children of God.<br />
 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br />
                                                                                                    <br />
 

This set of components is designed to keep graphics abstracted from the application, physics, networking, etc.<br />

<br />
See the "Notes.txt" document.
	The "Notes.txt" document gives step by step instructions of how to code from version 2.000 to 3.000.
	<br />

Goals:<br />
	Standard C++ where possible.<br />
	Current engines are tightly coupled, keep this toy engine loosely coupled. <br />
		Meaning, keep the following in separate libraries: <br />			
			Graphics<br />
			Windows & Keyboard Input<br />
			Physics (Plan to use Bullet Physics)<br />
			Audio <br />
			Networking<br />
                      <br />
	Help Students Learn Advanced C++ using DirectX12.<br />
	DirectX12 is complicated. Matthew5 version 1.000 creates all the basic components to get DirectX 12 up 
	and running and output one Triangle to the screen. It supports both desktop and Oculus Rift. 
	Version 2.000 add the ability to add multiple scene objects, however, each scene object only has 
	a single triangle. Version 2 also add "Frame Resources" to keep the Gpu busy.
	
	This is version 3.000. 
		Create a new object called "M5DxGpuMemoryPermanentBuffer" that uses the 
			Gpu default buffer. For data that does not change, this buffer is more 
			efficient. For example, the geometry for a chair does not change so it 
			can use this new buffer. The location of the chair will use the existing 
			class "M5DxGpuMemoryUploadBuffer because the location of the chair can 
			change.
		Add support for other types of scene objects beyond the single triangle. 
			The other geometry will be from external files.
			All geometry based on file loads. All, even box.
			File format ".obj" is supported to some level. See the Notes.txt doc for 
			details. Also, because of github settings to exclude un-needed visual studio files the ".obj" 
			example geometry file "Elephant.obj" had to have its extension changed to ".obj_REMOVE_THIS". 
			After downloading the extension should be changed back to ".obj".
			  
		
	
	Each new version will add a small amount of functionality to keep learning easier.<br />

	This repository will not be updated to add new functionality.
	It will stay Version 3.000 unless there is a bug fix.  
	This allows students to easily get the version they need. 
                                                                                  
	This version adds the library "tinyobjloader". This allows the loading of .obj files 
	to support different geometry. You can use Blender to create some geometry and then  
	export to obj format. However, for this version objects are still a solid color of 
	red/maroon.

Matthew5Graphics lib<br />
	Version 3.000<br />
	
	The Matthew5Graphics class derives from the IMatthew5Graphics abstract class.
	The IMatthew5Graphics class now has 2 functions. <br />
	One method/function, is Draw(..). 
	The Draw method takes one parameter, IMatthew5DrawInstructions, which for this version only 
	contains the camera position.  <br />
	The second function is AddSceneObject(..). This takes a parameter of type M5SceneObjectCpuPosition.
	This indicates where the scene object should be place. The client can call this function 
	as many times as they wish to add scene objects. For this version, each scene object is 
	an odd shaped box called "Elephant".
	
	To construct a Matthew5Graphics object the client only needs to supply a Windows HWND.
	This supports Desktop graphics; however, base classes can be overridden to support other graphics 
	platforms. See below in a seperate library for the Oculus implementation that uses this library.
	
	High level overview of components

			use the same Root Signature, Shaders and PSO provided by this base class.
			Interface:
				Matthew5Dx(HWND vHWND);

				virtual std::int32_t AddSceneObject(M5SceneObjectCpuPosition vM5SceneObjectCpuPosition) = 0;

				M5DxGpuDeviceNFactory 	
				M5DxGpuCommand				
				M5DxGpuSwapChain				
				Root Signature 
				Shaders
				PSO
				Frame Resources

				ID3D12CommandAllocator & GetCommandAllocator(int vIndex);
				ID3D12GraphicsCommandList & GetCommandList(int vIndex);

				M5SceneObject(ID3D12Device & vrpID3D12Device);
				D3D12_GPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS GetGpuConstBufferAddressThatHasWorldSpaceNMoreData(void);
				M5TriCpuGpuResources & GetM5TriCpuGpuResources(void);
				void SetM5TriCpuGpuResources(std::unique_ptr<M5TriCpuGpuResources> vpM5TriCpuGpuResources);

				This keeps all the scene objects for a given frame.
				This keeps all the camera positions for a given frame.

	High level overview of Desktop components 

		Matthew5DxDesktop : public Matthew5Dx
			This implements desktop specific code.
			
		Matthew5DxDesktopSwapChain : IMatthew5SwapChain
			This provides swap chain functionality specific to Desktop.

<br />
Matthew5GraphicsOculus <br />
	Version 3.000<br />
	This provides an Oculus implementation of the Matthew5Graphics::IMatthew5Graphics interface.
	This provides the same functionality as the Desktop, but with the Oculus Rift.
	Like the desktop version, this outputs one Elephant box for each scene object added. 
	The Oculus implementation has some extra complexities because the HMD moves and requires 
	two render processes per frame, one for each eye.
	The Matthew5DxOculus class derives from Matthew5Dx which derives from IMatthew5Graphics.
	This uses the same Shaders, Root Signature, PSO and so on that are used by the Desktop.
	To reduce code, there is no mirror support so the desktop window will not have anything showing, 
	only the Oculus Rift will show the triangles.

<br />

Matthew5Windows lib <br />
	Version 1.000 <br />
	Keep Windows and user input as separate from the Graphics as much as possible.
	This creates a window and provide the HWND to the client.  
	This provides a simple API to the client for getting user keyboard and mouse actions. 	

	High level overview of components
		Matthew5Windows
			Interface:
				Matthew5Windows(HINSTANCE vHINSTANCE, int vWindowWidth, int vWindowHeight);
				Matthew5WindowsUserHoldingKeys & GetWindowsMessages(void);
				HWND GetHWND(void);
		Matthew5WindowsUserHoldingKeys - struct
			public Properties/interface:
				bool CharHit(char c);
				bool UpArrow, LeftArrow, DownArrow, RightArrow;
				bool Control, Escape,SpaceBar, Shift, Tab;			
				bool CloseProgram = false;
				bool MouseLeft, MouseMiddle, MouseRight;
				int  MouseClickX, MouseClickY;
				int MouseCurrentX;
				int MouseCurrentY;
				int MouseClickAndHoldMoveX, MouseClickAndHoldMoveY;
				int GetMouseMoveX(void); 	
				int GetMouseMoveY(void)
					
<br />
<br />

Matthew5 exe <br />
	Version 3.000 <br />
	This uses Matthew5Windows to create a basic window and to get user keyboard input.
	Next, this creates a IMatthew5Graphics interface, a pointer. If Oculus is it will be pointing to 
	an instance of Matthew5DxOculus, if not then it will be pointing to Matthew5DxDesktop.
	However, the "exe" client code in main only uses the IMatthew5Graphics functions, nothing from 
	derived classes.
	Four scene objects are added at different locations; each scene object is the odd shaped "Elephant" box.
	Last, this takes user input from the W or S keys to update the camera position.
	Last last, this calls IMatthew5Graphics::Draw(..) over and over, passing the camera position.
	
	Note there is no timing logic in this simple example so the Desktop version moves the camera much 
	faster that the Oculus version because the Desktop has a mush faster frame rate.

History

Bought from Amazon "3D Game Programming with DirectX 12" by Frank Luna. 
	Good book. I didn't read all of it but it was very helpful. This book does not have any Oculus information but covers DirectX12.<br />
Read many pages from Microsoft's DirectX 12 Programming Guide
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3d12/directx-12-programming-guide  <br />
Reviewed Oculus Rift DirectX developer Examples.<br />
Reviewed many help sites, blogs, examples, etc...
